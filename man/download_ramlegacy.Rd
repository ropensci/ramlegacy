\usage{
download_ramlegacy(version = NULL, ram_path = NULL,
  ram_url = "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2542918",
  overwrite = FALSE, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{version}{A character vector of length 1 specifying the version number
of the database that should be downloaded. As of writing this package, the
available versions are "1.0","2.0", "2.5", "3.0", "4.3", "4.40", "4.41",
and "4.44". If the version argument is not specified then it defaults
to latest version (currently latest version is "4.44").}

\item{ram_path}{A string specifying the path of the local directory where
database will be downloaded. By default this path is set to the location
provided by \pkg{rappdirs} package and can be viewed by calling
\code{\link{ram_dir}}. Although this is not the \strong{recommended}
approach \code{download_ramlegacy} supports downloading to a user-specified path.}

\item{ram_url}{A string. By default it is set to the zenodo url of the database.
Please \strong{do not pass} in any other url to \code{ram_url}.}

\item{overwrite}{This argument is only relevant if you are trying to
re-download a version that is already present locally in the rappdirs
directory. If overwrite = TRUE then user will not encounter the interactive prompt
that confirms whether to overwrite the version present locally.}

\item{quiet}{If TRUE, suppress status messages}
}
\description{
Downloads a specified version of RAM Legacy Stock Assessment
Excel Database and as an RDS object to a local directory specified by
\code{\link{ram_dir}}. The function will check if the version requested
already exists on the user's computer and if it does then it prompts the user
to download it again unless `overwrite = TRUE` in which case the function will
download the version without displaying the prompt. The function also supports
downloading all the older versions (1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.3) from
[a github repo](www.github.com/kshtzgupta1/ramlegacy-assets)
